Hey, there ðŸ‘‹ For the past few weeks, I've been mulling over what shiny technology or side project I should start working on. I currently have numerous ideas swimming in my head and it's been difficult for me to prioritize. So, let's start with an introduction and go from there.

A brief introduction about myself - I'm a software engineer at a sustainability startup who's passionate about animal rights activism and education. I enjoy cycling across the tiny island of Singapore, experimenting in my kitchen and exploring the neighbourhood in search of the next good pint of beer.

I want to use this platform primarily to share my learnings as a developer and occasionally share my experiences from other aspects of my life.

Thank you for reading this and goodbye for now!
